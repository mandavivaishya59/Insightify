# Enhance Logical Summaries for All Dataset Types

## Education Dataset Enhancements
- [ ] Add gender-based performance analysis (if Gender column exists)
- [ ] Add grade classification (Pass/Fail/Distinction based on thresholds)
- [ ] Include detailed subject-wise insights (variability, correlations)
- [ ] Add performance distribution analysis

## Business Dataset Enhancements
- [ ] Add growth rates calculation (if time-based data exists)
- [ ] Add profitability ratios (profit margins, ROI)
- [ ] Include top products/regions analysis
- [ ] Add market concentration analysis (Herfindahl index approximation)

## HR Dataset Enhancements
- [ ] Add salary distribution analysis (quartiles, averages by department)
- [ ] Include departmental insights (headcount, salary ranges)
- [ ] Add experience/retention analysis (if tenure data exists)
- [ ] Include diversity metrics (if gender/ethnicity data exists)

## Time Series Dataset Enhancements
- [ ] Add trend detection (increasing/decreasing patterns)
- [ ] Include seasonality analysis (if applicable)
- [ ] Add growth rates over time periods
- [ ] Include volatility analysis

## Generic Dataset Enhancements
- [ ] Smarter pattern detection (customer data, product catalogs, etc.)
- [ ] Add data type distribution insights
- [ ] Include missing value analysis
- [ ] Add correlation insights for numeric data

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Update detect_dataset_type for better detection
- [ ] Enhance generate_logical_summary function
- [ ] Test with sample data for each type
